Welcome to the **Codsoft Internship Python Programmer**!ðŸŒŸ
Here, you'll find a showcase of my journey and achievements during the internship, featuring hands-on projects that delve into various facets of Python Language. Dive into the realm of predictive analytics and classification with the following projects:

## Projects

### 1. **API INTEGRATION AND VISUALIZATION** ðŸ“ˆ
- **Description:** Explore the power of predictive modeling as I leverage Python to Visualize the climate prediction. Uncover the intricacies of the dataset and witness how advanced algorithms can accurately predict Climatic changes by years
- **Highlights:**
  1. Setting up a Python environment for API integration and data visualization.
  2. Fetching 5-day weather forecast data using the OpenWeatherMap API.
  3. Parsing and extracting temperature and humidity data from the API response.
  4. Visualizing trends in temperature and humidity over time using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Technology used:**
- **Python**: Programming language for API integration and data manipulation.
- **Requests**: Library for making HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **Matplotlib**: Library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualization library built on Matplotlib.

Feel free to explore the code, datasets, and documentation provided in each project. Your feedback and insights are greatly appreciated as I continue to refine and expand my skills in the dynamic field of Python Programming. Happy coding! ðŸš€ðŸ“Š
